# GameOfLifeFinal

GameOfLife

A zero-player game called Game Of Life which is a cellular automaton created in Java for a project at Oslo and Akershus College University. Still in the planning stage, but these are some of the functions we will implement in the final program:

Start/pause button
Labels for living cells
Speed (slider)
Zoom (slider avaFX)
In addition there will be features such as:

Dynamic Board
3D rendering of the game
Statistics
Sound representation of the board
Figure Editor
Unit testing
... and many more!

Here is an early prototype GUI of this program screenshot
